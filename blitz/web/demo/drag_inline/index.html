		A canvas actually has two sizes: the size of the element itself and the size of the element's drawing surface.
		Setting
		the element's width and height attributes sets both of these sizes; CSS attributes affect only the element's
		size and
		not the drawing surface.

		By default, both the canvas element's size and the size of its drawing surface is 300 screen pixels wide and 150
		screen
		pixels high. In the listing shown in the example, which uses CSS to set the canvas element's size, the size of
		the
		element is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels high, but the size of the drawing surface remains unchanged at the
		default
		value of 300 pixels × 150 pixels. When a canvas element's size does not match the size of its drawing surface,
		the
		browser scales the drawing surface to fit the element (which may result in surprising and unwanted effects).

		Example on setting element size and drawing surface size to different values:
